GameGrid.js is an HTML5/Javascript based two-dimensional grid.

It is highly scalable and configurable.
It should serve as an API for grid-based games such as check or RPGs.

(Planned) Usage:
<script type="text/javascript" src="GameGrid.js"></script>

function init() {
  var gameGrid = new GameGrid("mygrid");
}

<body onload="init();">
  <div id="mygrid"></div>
</html>
